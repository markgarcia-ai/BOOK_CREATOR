## Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. The key concepts include:

1. **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled examples
2. **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data  
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Learning through interaction and feedback

## Key Algorithms

### Linear Regression
Linear regression is used for predicting continuous values. It finds the best line through data points.

### Decision Trees
Decision trees make decisions by asking a series of yes/no questions about the data.

### Neural Networks
Neural networks are inspired by the human brain and can learn complex patterns.

## Applications

Machine learning is used in:
- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Autonomous vehicles
- Medical diagnosis

## Future Trends

The field is rapidly evolving with advances in:
- Deep learning
- Transfer learning
- Explainable AI
- Edge computing
