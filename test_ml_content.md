## Introduction to Machine Learning
Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on algorithms that can learn from data. The key concepts include supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

## Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

## Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds patterns in data without labeled examples. Techniques include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and association rule learning.

## Model Evaluation
Model evaluation is crucial for assessing performance. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for classification tasks.
