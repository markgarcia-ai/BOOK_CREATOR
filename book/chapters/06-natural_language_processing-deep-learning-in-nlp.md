## Introduction to Deep Learning in Natural Language ProcessingDeep learning has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by introducing sophisticated neural network architectures that can capture complex linguistic patterns and semantic relationships [@Goodfellow2016]. This chapter explores the most impactful deep learning techniques transforming language understanding and generation.### Recurrent Neural Networks#### Basic ArchitectureRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are designed to process sequential data like text by maintaining an internal memory state. The core RNN architecture can be represented by the following update equations:$h_t = tanh(W_{hh} h_{t-1} + W_{xh} x_t + b_h)$$y_t = W_{hy} h_t + b_y$Where:- $h_t$ is the hidden state- $x_t$ is the input at time step $t$- $W$ represents weight matrices- $b$ represents bias terms{{FIG:rnn-architecture:'Typical RNN Architecture with Unrolled Computational Graph'}}#### Challenges with Traditional RNNsTraditional RNNs suffer from two primary limitations:1. Vanishing gradient problem2. Difficulty capturing long-range dependencies [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]#### Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)LSTMs solve these challenges through gating mechanisms that control information flow:$f_t = sigma(W_f [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f)$$i_t = sigma(W_i [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i)$### Transformer Architecture#### Self-Attention MechanismThe transformer introduced self-attention, allowing models to dynamically focus on different parts of the input sequence:$Attention(Q, K, V) = softmax(frac{QK^T}{sqrt{d_k)})V$Key components include:- Multi-head attention- Positional encoding- Feed-forward neural networks{{FIG:transformer-architecture:'Transformer Model Architecture'}}### BERT and Contextual Embeddings#### Bidirectional ContextBERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) represents a breakthrough in contextual representation [@Devlin2018]. By using masked language modeling and next sentence prediction, BERT generates rich contextual embeddings.#### Pre-training and Fine-tuningBERT's architecture enables transfer learning across multiple NLP tasks:- Pre-training on large text corpora- Fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks### Advanced Transformer Variants1.
