## Neural Network Fundamentals

Neural networks are computational models inspired by the human brain's biological neural networks [@Nielsen2015]. They consist of interconnected nodes or 'neurons' organized in layers that process and transmit information.

### Basic Architecture

A typical neural network has three primary layers:
- **Input Layer**: Receives initial data
- **Hidden Layer(s)**: Processes intermediate computations
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions
