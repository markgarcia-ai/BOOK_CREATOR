## Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are powerful computational models inspired by the human brain's biological neural networks. They form the foundation of deep learning and have revolutionized numerous domains, from image recognition to natural language processing [@Nielsen2015].

## Neural Network Structure

### Neurons: The Basic Building Blocks
A neural network consists of interconnected neurons organized in layers. Each neuron receives inputs, processes them, and generates an output. The basic structure includes:

- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data features
- **Hidden Layers**: Process and transform information
- **Output Layer**: Generates final predictions
