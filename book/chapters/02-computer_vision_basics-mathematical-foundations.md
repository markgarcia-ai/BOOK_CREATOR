## Introduction

Computer vision relies on sophisticated mathematical techniques that enable machines to interpret and understand visual information. This chapter explores the critical mathematical foundations that power modern computer vision algorithms.

## Linear Algebra for Image Processing

### Vectors and Matrix Operations

Linear algebra provides the fundamental mathematical framework for image processing. Images can be represented as matrices, where each element represents pixel intensity [@szeliski2010computer]. Key linear algebraic operations include:

- Matrix multiplication
- Eigenvalue decomposition
- Linear transformations

#### Matrix Representation of Images

An image $I$ can be represented as a matrix $M \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$, where $m$ and $n$ represent image height and width:

$$I = \begin{bmatrix} 
p_{11} & p_{12} & \cdots & p_{1n} \\
p_{21} & p_{22} & \cdots & p_{2n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
p_{m1} & p_{m2} & \cdots & p_{mn}
\end{bmatrix}$$

### Linear Transformations in Computer Vision

Linear transformations are crucial for:
- Image rotation
- Scaling
- Translation
- Perspective warping [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

## Image Representation Mathematics

### Color Space Mathematics

Color spaces represent visual information using mathematical models. Common color spaces include:

1. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
2. HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)
3. CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black)

#### Color Space Conversions

Color space conversion involves linear transformations between different coordinate systems [@gonzalez2002digital].

### Pixel Encoding

Pixel values can be represented using various mathematical encoding techniques:
- Grayscale: Single intensity value
- Color: Multi-channel representation
- Normalized values: $[0, 1]$ or $[-1, 1]$

## Statistical Image Analysis

### Probability in Image Processing

Statistical techniques help characterize and analyze visual data. Key concepts include:

- Probability distributions of pixel intensities
- Image histograms
- Statistical moments (mean, variance, skewness)

#### Probability Density Function

The probability density function $f(x)$ describes pixel intensity distribution:

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{(x - \mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right)$$

### Random Field Models

Images can be modeled as random fields, enabling probabilistic analysis and inference [@besag1986statistical].

## Optimization Techniques

### Gradient Descent in Computer Vision

Gradient descent is fundamental for optimizing vision algorithms:

$$ \theta_{t+1} = \theta_t - \alpha \nabla J(\theta) $$

Where:
- $\theta$ represents model parameters
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $J(\theta)$ is the cost function

### Stochastic Optimization

Modern computer vision leverages advanced optimization techniques:
- Adam optimizer
- RMSprop
- Adaptive learning rates
