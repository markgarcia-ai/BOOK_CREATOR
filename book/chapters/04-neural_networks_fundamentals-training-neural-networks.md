## Introduction

Neural network training is a complex process that transforms raw data into intelligent predictive models. This chapter explores the fundamental techniques and strategies for effectively training neural networks.

## Backpropagation

### Core Training Algorithm

Backpropagation is the foundational algorithm for neural network training [@Rumelhart1986]. It enables networks to learn by systematically adjusting weights based on the error between predicted and actual outputs.

The key steps include:

1. Forward propagation of input data
2. Calculating the error at the output layer
3. Backward propagation of error gradients
4. Weight updates using gradient descent

### Mathematical Representation

The core backpropagation update rule can be represented as:

$w_{ij} = w_{ij} - \alpha \cdot \frac{partial E}{partial w_{ij}}$

Where:
- $w_{ij}$ represents network weights
- $\alpha$ is the learning rate
- $\frac{partial E}{partial w_{ij}}$ indicates the gradient of error with respect to weights

## Optimization Algorithms

### Gradient Descent Variants

#### Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
- Updates weights after each training example
- Faster convergence but higher variance [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

#### Adam Optimizer
- Adaptive learning rates for each parameter
- Combines benefits of RMSprop and momentum [@Kingma2014]

### Advanced Techniques

- Momentum optimization
- RMSprop
- Adaptive learning rate methods

## Regularization Methods

### Preventing Overfitting

Regularization techniques help prevent neural networks from memorizing training data:

1. **L1/L2 Regularization**: Add penalty terms to loss function
2. **Dropout**: Randomly deactivate neurons during training
3. **Early Stopping**: Halt training when validation performance degrades
