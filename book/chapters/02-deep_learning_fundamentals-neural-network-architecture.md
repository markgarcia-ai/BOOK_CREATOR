## Chapter 2: Neural Network Architecture

Neural networks represent a powerful computational paradigm inspired by biological neural systems, enabling complex pattern recognition and learning across numerous domains. This chapter explores the fundamental architecture, design principles, and critical components that make neural networks a cornerstone of modern machine learning.

### Neuron and Layer Fundamentals

#### Basic Neural Network Structure
A neural network is composed of interconnected nodes, or neurons, organized into distinct layers. Each neuron receives input signals, processes them, and generates an output signal using a transformation function [@Nielsen2015:NeuralNetworks].

#### Key Components
1. **Input Layer**: Receives raw data features
2. **Hidden Layers**: Perform intermediate computations
3. **Output Layer**: Generates final network predictions

The fundamental computation of a neuron can be represented mathematically as:

$y = f(\\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_i x_i + b)$

Where:
- $y$ is the neuron's output
- $w_i$ are connection weights
- $x_i$ are input values
- $b$ is the bias term
- $f()$ is the activation function [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
