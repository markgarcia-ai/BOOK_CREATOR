## Introduction

Data preparation is a critical phase in machine learning that transforms raw data into a format suitable for model training [@goodfellow2016deep]. This chapter explores the essential techniques for collecting, cleaning, and engineering features that form the foundation of successful machine learning projects.

## Data Collection and Sources

### Types of Data Sources
- Structured databases
- Web scraping
- Public datasets
- Sensor and IoT devices [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

### Data Acquisition Strategies
- Identify reliable and relevant data sources
- Ensure data represents the problem domain
- Consider data licensing and usage rights [@provost2013data]

## Data Cleaning Techniques

### Handling Missing Values
- Deletion strategies
- Imputation methods:
  - Mean/median replacement
  - Advanced techniques like KNN imputation

### Outlier Detection and Treatment
- Statistical methods:
  - Z-score method: $z = frac{x - mu}{sigma}$
  - Interquartile range (IQR) method
- Machine learning techniques for anomaly detection [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

## Feature Engineering

### Feature Transformation
- Normalization: $x_{normalized} = frac{x - x_{min}}{x_{max} - x_{min}}$
- Standardization: $x_{standardized} = frac{x - mu}{sigma}$
- Logarithmic and exponential transformations

### Feature Selection Techniques
- Correlation analysis
- Mutual information
- Recursive feature elimination
- Regularization methods (Lasso, Ridge) [@hastie2009elements]

## Summary

Data preparation is a complex but crucial process that significantly impacts machine learning model performance. By carefully collecting, cleaning, and engineering features, data scientists can create more robust and accurate predictive models.

## Key Takeaways
- Data quality directly influences model performance
- Multiple techniques exist for handling missing values and outliers
- Feature engineering transforms raw data into meaningful representations
- Systematic data preparation is essential for successful machine learning projects
