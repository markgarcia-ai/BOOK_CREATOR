## Introduction to Quantum Mechanics

Quantum mechanics represents a fundamental departure from classical physics, providing a probabilistic framework for understanding atomic and subatomic behavior [@Griffiths2016]. Unlike classical systems, quantum mechanics introduces revolutionary concepts that challenge our intuitive understanding of reality.

## Quantum Superposition

### Wave-Particle Duality
Quantum systems exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, a phenomenon known as wave-particle duality [@Feynman1985]. An electron, for instance, can behave simultaneously as a discrete particle and a wave, described by its probability amplitude $\psi(x,t)$.

### Probability Amplitudes
In quantum mechanics, a system's state is represented by a complex-valued wave function $\psi$. The probability of measuring a particular state is given by $|\psi|^2$, demonstrating the probabilistic nature of quantum systems [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

## Quantum Entanglement

### Non-Local Quantum Interactions
Quantum entanglement describes a unique quantum mechanical phenomenon where two particles become correlated such that the quantum state of each particle cannot be described independently, even when separated by large distances [@Aspect1982].

### Spooky Action at a Distance
Einstein referred to entanglement as
