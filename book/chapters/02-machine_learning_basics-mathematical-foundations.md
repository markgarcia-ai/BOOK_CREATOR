## Introduction

Machine learning is fundamentally a mathematical discipline, requiring a solid understanding of key mathematical concepts. This chapter explores the essential mathematical foundations that power machine learning algorithms.

## Linear Algebra Basics

### Vector and Matrix Operations

Linear algebra provides the fundamental mathematical language for machine learning. Vectors and matrices are crucial for representing data and transforming information [@goodfellow2016deep].

Key concepts include:
- Vector representation: $\vec{x} = [x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n]$
- Matrix multiplication
- Eigenvalue decomposition

#### Matrix Transformations

Matrices allow us to transform data efficiently. A simple linear transformation can be represented as:

$$y = Ax + b$$

Where:
- $A$ is the transformation matrix
- $x$ is the input vector
- $b$ is the bias vector
