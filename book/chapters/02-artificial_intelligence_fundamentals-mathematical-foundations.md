## Introduction

Mathematics provides the fundamental language and toolkit for understanding and developing artificial intelligence algorithms. This chapter explores the critical mathematical foundations that underpin machine learning and AI systems.

## Linear Algebra for AI

### Vector Spaces and Transformations

Linear algebra is the mathematical backbone of machine learning, providing powerful tools for representing and manipulating data [@Anton2018]. Vectors and matrices allow us to efficiently represent complex information and perform computational transformations.

Key linear algebra concepts include:

- **Vector Operations**: Addition, scaling, dot product
- **Matrix Transformations**: Linear mappings and dimensional reductions
- **Eigenvalue Decomposition**: Principal component analysis and dimensionality reduction

#### Example: Vector Representation

Consider a simple data point representing a customer's attributes:

$\vec{x} = [age, income, spending\_score]$

This vector allows us to represent multidimensional information compactly.

### Matrix Operations in Machine Learning

Matrices are crucial for representing datasets, performing linear transformations, and implementing algorithms like neural networks [@Goodfellow2016].

$$A = \begin{bmatrix} 
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}$$

Common matrix operations include multiplication, transposition, and decomposition.

## Probability and Statistical Reasoning

### Probability Foundations

Probability theory provides a framework for understanding uncertainty and making probabilistic predictions [@Bishop2006].

Key probabilistic concepts:
- **Conditional Probability**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$
- **Bayes' Theorem**: $P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)}$
- **Random Variables**: Quantifying uncertain outcomes

### Statistical Inference

Statistical methods help extract meaningful insights from data:

- Hypothesis testing
- Maximum likelihood estimation
- Bayesian inference
