## Introduction

Blockchain technology continues to evolve rapidly, presenting both exciting opportunities and significant challenges for the digital ecosystem [@nakamoto2008bitcoin]. This chapter explores the emerging trends, technological developments, and potential transformations that will shape blockchain's future.

## Scalability Challenges

### Current Blockchain Limitations
Blockchain networks face critical scalability issues that restrict widespread adoption. Current blockchain platforms like Bitcoin and Ethereum can only process a limited number of transactions per second [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]:

- Bitcoin: ~7 transactions/second
- Ethereum: ~15 transactions/second
- Visa: ~24,000 transactions/second

### Proposed Scaling Solutions
Several innovative approaches are emerging to address scalability:

#### Layer 2 Protocols
- **Lightning Network**: Off-chain transaction channels [@poon2016bitcoin]
- **Plasma**: Ethereum's child blockchain framework
- **Sidechains**: Independent blockchains connected to main chain

#### Consensus Mechanism Innovations
- Proof of Stake (PoS)
- Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS)
- Sharding techniques to distribute network load
