## Introduction to Supervised LearningSupervised learning represents a fundamental paradigm in machine learning where algorithms learn from labeled training data to make predictions or decisions [@hastie2009elements]. In this approach, the model is provided with input-output pairs, allowing it to learn the mapping between features and target variables.### Regression ModelsRegression algorithms predict continuous numerical values based on input features. Two primary regression techniques are critical in data science:#### Linear RegressionLinear regression models the relationship between dependent and independent variables using a linear equation:$y = mx + b$Where:- $y$ is the predicted value- $x$ is the input feature- $m$ is the slope- $b$ is the y-intercept{{FIG:linear-regression:'Linear Regression Model Visualization'}}Key characteristics include:- Simple and interpretable- Assumes linear relationship between variables- Sensitive to outliers [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]#### Logistic RegressionDespite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems, predicting probability using the sigmoid function:$P(y) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$Where $z$ represents the linear combination of features.### Classification AlgorithmsClassification algorithms categorize data into predefined classes.#### Decision TreesDecision trees create a tree-like model of decisions and their potential consequences. They recursively split data based on feature conditions.{{FIG:decision-tree:'Example Decision Tree Structure'}}Strengths:- Highly interpretable- Handle both numerical and categorical data- Can capture non-linear relationships [@breiman1984classification]#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)SVM finds the optimal hyperplane that best separates different classes in high-dimensional space.Key properties:- Effective in high-dimensional spaces- Works well with clear margin of separation- Versatile through different kernel functions#### Naive BayesA probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between features.$P(class|features) = frac{P(features|class) * P(class)}{P(features)}$### Ensemble MethodsEnsemble techniques combine multiple models to improve predictive performance.#### Random ForestsAn ensemble of decision trees where each tree votes for a class, with the majority determining the final prediction.{{FIG:random-forest:'Random Forest Ensemble Visualization'}}#### Boosting TechniquesBoosting algorithms like AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting sequentially train weak learners, with each subsequent model focusing on previous models' errors.**Summary**Supervised learning provides powerful techniques for predicting and classifying data by learning from labeled examples, utilizing various algorithmic approaches across regression and classification domains.**Key Takeaways**:- Supervised learning requires labeled training data- Regression predicts continuous values- Classification assigns data to discrete categories- Ensemble methods can significantly improve predictive performance- Model selection depends on data characteristics and problem domain
