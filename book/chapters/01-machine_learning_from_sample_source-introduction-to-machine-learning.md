## Defining Machine Learning

Machine learning is a transformative subset of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed [@samuel1959]. At its core, machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that can automatically detect patterns in data and make intelligent decisions [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

### Historical Context

The concept of machine learning emerged in the 1950s, with pioneering work by researchers like Arthur Samuel, who defined machine learning as a field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed [@samuel1959].

## Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, algorithms learn from labeled training data, predicting outcomes for new, unseen data. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines

### Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning discovers hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Key techniques include:
- Clustering
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning involves an agent learning to make decisions by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions [@sutton1998].

## Real-World Applications

Machine learning has transformative applications across industries:

### Computer Vision
- Image recognition
- Facial detection
- Autonomous vehicle perception
