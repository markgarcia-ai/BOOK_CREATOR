## Chapter 7: Error Handling

In the world of Python programming, understanding how to manage and prevent errors is crucial for writing robust and reliable code. This chapter will explore essential techniques for handling exceptions, identifying common error types, and developing effective debugging strategies.

### Try-Except Blocks
