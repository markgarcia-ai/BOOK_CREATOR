## Introduction to Quantum Computing Applications

Quantum computing offers transformative potential across multiple domains by leveraging quantum mechanical principles to solve complex computational problems more efficiently than classical computing systems [@Nielsen2010].

### Cryptography and Security

Quantum computing presents revolutionary approaches to encryption and cybersecurity:

- **Quantum Key Distribution**: Enables theoretically unbreakable communication channels [@Gisin2002]
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Developing algorithms resistant to quantum attacks [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
- **Quantum Random Number Generation**: Producing truly unpredictable cryptographic keys
