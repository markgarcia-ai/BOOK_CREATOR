## Introduction to Core Machine Learning AlgorithmsMachine learning algorithms are the computational engines that transform raw data into intelligent predictions and insights [@Mitchell2017]. This chapter explores fundamental techniques that form the backbone of modern data science and artificial intelligence.### Regression AlgorithmsRegression algorithms predict continuous numerical values based on input features. Two primary approaches dominate this domain:#### Linear RegressionLinear regression models the relationship between variables using a linear equation: $y = mx + b$Where:- $y$ represents the predicted output- $x$ represents input features- $m$ represents the slope- $b$ represents the y-intercept{{FIG:linear-regression:'Linear Regression Model Visualization'}}Key characteristics:- Simple and interpretable- Assumes linear relationship between variables- Sensitive to outliers [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]#### Logistic RegressionDespite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems:$P(y) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$Where $z$ represents the linear combination of input features.### Classification MethodsClassification algorithms categorize data into predefined classes:#### Decision TreesDecision trees segment data by creating hierarchical decision rules. Each node represents a feature, and branches represent decision paths.{{FIG:decision-tree:'Sample Decision Tree Structure'}}#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)SVMs find optimal hyperplanes that maximize margin between different classes [@Cortes1995].#### Naive BayesA probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions.### Clustering TechniquesUnsupervised learning algorithms that group similar data points:#### K-Means ClusteringPartitions data into $k$ clusters based on feature similarity.Algorithm steps:1. Initialize $k$ cluster centroids2. Assign data points to nearest centroid3. Recalculate centroids4. Repeat until convergence{{FIG:kmeans-clustering:'K-Means Clustering Visualization'}}## SummaryMachine learning algorithms provide powerful tools for extracting insights from complex datasets, ranging from predictive regression to sophisticated classification and clustering techniques.## Key Takeaways- Regression algorithms predict continuous values- Classification methods categorize data into discrete classes- Clustering techniques discover inherent data groupings- Each algorithm has unique strengths and application domains- Choosing the right algorithm depends on data characteristics and problem requirements
