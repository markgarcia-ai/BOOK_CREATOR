## Introduction to Image Preprocessing

Image preprocessing is a critical stage in computer vision workflows that transforms raw visual data into a format suitable for advanced analysis and machine learning algorithms [@Gonzalez2018]. By applying sophisticated techniques, we can enhance image quality, extract meaningful features, and prepare data for subsequent computational tasks.

### Image Filtering

#### Noise Reduction Techniques
Digital images often contain noise that can degrade analysis quality. Common filtering methods include:

1. **Gaussian Blur**: Reduces high-frequency noise by convolving the image with a Gaussian kernel
   $$ G(x,y) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma^2} e^{-\frac{x^2 + y^2}{2\sigma^2}} $$

2. **Median Filter**: Replaces each pixel's value with the median of neighboring pixel intensities [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

3. **Bilateral Filtering**: Preserves edges while smoothing regions {{FIG:bilateral-filter:'Bilateral filtering comparison'}}

#### Edge Detection
Edge detection algorithms identify significant intensity transitions:

- Sobel Operator
- Canny Edge Detection 
- Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)

### Color Space Transformations

#### Common Color Models
- RGB: Standard device-dependent color representation
- HSV: Hue, Saturation, Value model
- LAB: Perceptually uniform color space

Transformation equations:
$$ V_{HSV} = \max(R,G,B) $$

### Normalization and Standardization

#### Image Scaling Techniques
1. Min-Max Normalization
   $$ x_{normalized} = \frac{x - \min(x)}{\max(x) - \min(x)} $$

2. Z-Score Standardization
   $$ z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma} $$

### Feature Extraction

#### Key Feature Detection Methods
- SIFT (Scale-Invariant Feature Transform)
- SURF (Speeded Up Robust Features)
- Harris Corner Detection

### Advanced Preprocessing Strategies

#### Data Augmentation
Techniques to artificially expand training datasets:
- Rotation
- Flipping
- Adding controlled noise
- Perspective transformations

### Performance Considerations

Preprocessing computational complexity varies:
- Gaussian filtering: $O(n^2)$
- Median filtering: $O(n \log k)$ where $k$ is neighborhood size

**Summary**
Image preprocessing transforms raw visual data through filtering, color space conversion, normalization, and feature extraction, preparing images for advanced computer vision tasks.
