## Introduction to Data Structures in PythonPython offers several powerful built-in data structures that help programmers efficiently organize and manipulate data. This chapter will explore lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets, providing you with essential tools for managing information in your programs.## Lists: Dynamic and Flexible Collections### Creating and Modifying ListsLists are versatile, ordered collections that can contain mixed data types. You can create a list using square brackets:```pythonfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']mixed_list = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]```### List OperationsLists support various operations like appending, inserting, and slicing:```pythonfruits.append('orange')  # Add element to endfruits.insert(1, 'grape')  # Insert at specific indexsubset = fruits[1:3]  # Slice list```## Dictionaries: Key-Value Pair Structures### Dictionary BasicsDictionaries store key-value pairs, allowing fast lookups and dynamic data storage:```pythonstudent = {    'name': 'Alice',    'age': 22,    'grades': [85, 90, 88]}```### Dictionary Methods```pythonstudent['major'] = 'Computer Science'  # Add new key-valuestudent.get('email', 'Not provided')  # Safe key access```## Tuples and Sets: Specialized Collections### Tuples: Immutable SequencesTuples are unchangeable ordered collections:```pythoncoordinates = (10, 20)point = tuple([1, 2, 3])  # Convert list to tuple```### Sets: Unique, Unordered ElementsSets store unique elements and support set operations:```pythonunique_numbers = {1, 2, 3, 2}  # Duplicate removedmath_students = {'Alice', 'Bob'}cs_students = {'Bob', 'Charlie'}```## SummaryPython's data structures provide flexible ways to store, organize, and manipulate data efficiently. Each structure has unique properties suited to different programming scenarios.## Key Takeaways- Lists are dynamic, mutable collections- Dictionaries store key-value pairs for fast lookups- Tuples are immutable sequences- Sets maintain unique, unordered elements- Choose the right data structure based on your specific requirements
