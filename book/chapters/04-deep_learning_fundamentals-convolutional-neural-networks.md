## Introduction to Convolutional Neural Networks

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) represent a pivotal breakthrough in deep learning, particularly for processing spatial data like images [@LeCun2015]. These specialized neural networks have revolutionized computer vision and pattern recognition tasks.

### CNN Architecture Fundamentals

#### Convolutional Layers
CNNs use convolutional layers to extract spatial features from input data. The core operation can be represented mathematically as:

$y = f(W * x + b)$

Where:
- $W$ represents the convolutional kernel
- $*$ denotes convolution operation
- $b$ is the bias term
- $f$ is a non-linear activation function [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
