## Introduction to Fundamental Machine Learning AlgorithmsMachine learning algorithms are the core tools that enable computers to learn from data and make intelligent predictions or decisions [@Mitchell1997]. This chapter explores three fundamental algorithms that form the backbone of many machine learning applications.### Linear Regression: Predicting Continuous ValuesLinear regression is a foundational supervised learning algorithm used to predict continuous numeric outcomes. At its core, it establishes a linear relationship between input features and target variables.#### Mathematical RepresentationThe linear regression model can be represented as:$y = wx + b$Where:- $y$ is the predicted value- $w$ represents the model's weights- $x$ represents input features- $b$ is the bias term [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]{{FIG:linear-regression:'Linear Regression Model Visualization'}}#### Key Applications- Housing price prediction- Sales forecasting- Economic trend analysis [@Hastie2009]### Decision Trees: Structured Classification and RegressionDecision trees are versatile algorithms that create predictive models by breaking down complex decisions into a series of simpler binary choices.#### Tree Structure- **Root Node**: Initial decision point- **Internal Nodes**: Feature-based decision rules- **Leaf Nodes**: Final classification or regression outcome{{FIG:decision-tree:'Sample Decision Tree Structure'}}#### Advantages- Interpretable model structure- Handles both numerical and categorical data- Requires minimal data preprocessing [@Breiman2017]### Clustering Techniques: Discovering Data PatternsClustering algorithms group similar data points together without prior labeling, revealing hidden structures within datasets.#### Popular Clustering Methods- K-Means Clustering- Hierarchical Clustering- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering){{FIG:clustering:'Data Point Clustering Visualization'}}#### Real-World Applications- Customer segmentation- Anomaly detection- Image compression [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]## SummaryFundamental machine learning algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, and clustering techniques provide powerful tools for predictive modeling and data analysis, enabling sophisticated insights across various domains.## Key Takeaways- Linear regression predicts continuous values using linear relationships- Decision trees offer interpretable, structured classification approaches- Clustering algorithms discover hidden patterns in unlabeled data- Each algorithm has unique strengths for different problem domains- Understanding these fundamental techniques is crucial for advanced machine learning
