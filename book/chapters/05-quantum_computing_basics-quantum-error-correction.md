## Introduction to Quantum Error Correction

Quantum computing's immense potential is challenged by the fundamental fragility of quantum systems. Error correction represents a critical frontier in maintaining quantum computational integrity [@Nielsen2010].

## Quantum Decoherence Challenges

### Understanding Quantum System Instability

Quantum systems are inherently susceptible to environmental perturbations that cause decoherence [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]. Unlike classical computing, quantum states collapse rapidly when exposed to external noise, making error correction paramount.

#### Key Decoherence Mechanisms
- Thermal interactions
- Electromagnetic interference
- Quantum state measurement disruptions
