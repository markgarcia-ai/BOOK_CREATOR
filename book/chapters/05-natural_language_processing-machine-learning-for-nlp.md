## Introduction to Machine Learning in Natural Language Processing

Machine learning has revolutionized natural language processing (NLP) by enabling sophisticated computational approaches to understanding, analyzing, and generating human language [@Mitchell1997]. By applying advanced algorithms and statistical models, we can transform unstructured text data into meaningful insights and intelligent systems.

### Background and Foundations

Machine learning techniques provide powerful mechanisms for extracting patterns and knowledge from textual data. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, machine learning models can adapt and improve their performance through exposure to diverse training datasets [@Goodfellow2016].

## Text Classification

### Fundamental Concepts

Text classification involves categorizing documents or texts into predefined classes or categories. This fundamental NLP task has numerous practical applications, from spam detection to content recommendation {{FIG:text-classification:
