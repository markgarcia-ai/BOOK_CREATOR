## IntroductionNeural networks rely on two critical components to learn and perform effectively: loss functions and activation functions. These mathematical mechanisms enable networks to measure performance and introduce non-linear transformations, respectively.## Loss Function PrinciplesLoss functions quantify the difference between predicted and actual outputs, guiding network optimization. Key types include:### Mean Squared Error (MSE)$L = frac{1}{n} sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - hat{y}_i)^2$### Cross-Entropy LossParticularly effective for classification problems, measuring probabilistic divergence.## Common Activation Functions### ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)$f(x) = max(0, x)$Advantages:- Computationally efficient- Mitigates vanishing gradient problem [@Glorot2011]### Sigmoid$sigma(x) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$Used in binary classification scenarios [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]### Tanh$tanh(x) = frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$Provides zero-centered output, beneficial in hidden layers.## Choosing Appropriate FunctionsSelection depends on:- Network architecture- Problem domain- Computational constraints{{FIG:activation-comparison:'Comparison of Activation Functions'}}## SummaryLoss and activation functions are fundamental to neural network performance, providing mechanisms for learning and introducing non-linear transformations.## Key Takeaways- Loss functions measure network prediction errors- Activation functions introduce non-linearity- ReLU is often preferred in deep learning architectures- Function selection critically impacts network performance- Understanding mathematical properties is essential
