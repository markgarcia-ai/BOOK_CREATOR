## Introduction to Quantum Hardware

Quantum computing hardware represents a critical frontier in realizing practical quantum computational systems. Unlike classical computing, quantum hardware requires maintaining delicate quantum states with minimal environmental interference [@Nielsen2010quantum].

## Superconducting Qubits

### Fundamental Architecture
Superconducting qubits utilize engineered electrical circuits operating at extremely low temperatures, typically near absolute zero [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]. These quantum systems leverage Josephson junctions to create quantum coherent states.

#### Key Characteristics
- Ultra-low temperature operation (< 0.1 Kelvin)
- High controllability of quantum states
- Rapid gate operations ($10-100$ nanoseconds)
