## Introduction

Machine learning continues to evolve, pushing the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence. This chapter explores sophisticated algorithmic techniques that enable more nuanced, powerful, and precise predictive models.

## Ensemble Learning

### Fundamentals of Ensemble Methods
Ensemble learning represents a paradigm shift in machine learning, where multiple models collaborate to produce superior predictive performance [@breiman1996bagging]. By combining diverse algorithms, we can create more robust and accurate systems.

#### Key Ensemble Techniques

1. **Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)** 
   - Creates multiple subsets of training data
   - Trains independent models on each subset
   - Combines predictions through voting or averaging
   
   $$ Ensemble_{bagging} = \\frac{1}{N} \\sum_{i=1}^{N} Model_i $$

2. **Boosting**
   - Sequentially trains weak learners
   - Each subsequent model focuses on previous models' errors
   - Weights are adjusted to improve overall performance

3. **Stacking**
   - Trains multiple base models
   - Uses a meta-learner to combine their predictions
