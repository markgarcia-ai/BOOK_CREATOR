## Introduction to Neural Network Architectures

Neural networks represent a powerful class of machine learning models inspired by the biological neural structures of the human brain. These computational models have revolutionized numerous domains, from computer vision to natural language processing [@goodfellow2016deep].

## Feedforward Networks

### Basic Structure and Principles
Feedforward networks, also known as multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), represent the foundational architecture of neural networks. In these networks, information flows in one directionâ€”from input layer through hidden layers to the output layer [@Bishop2006].

#### Key Characteristics
- Neurons organized in discrete layers
- No feedback connections
- Typically trained using backpropagation
- Mathematical representation: $y = f(W^T x + b)$

### Activation Functions
Different activation functions enable neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships:

1. **Sigmoid**: $\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$
2. **ReLU**: $f(x) = \max(0, x)$
3. **Tanh**: $\tanh(x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}}$
