## Introduction to Quantum Computing Fundamentals

Quantum computing represents a paradigm shift in computational capabilities, moving beyond classical binary computing by leveraging quantum mechanical principles [@Nielsen2010:QuantumComputation]. This chapter explores the fundamental building blocks of quantum computation: qubits and quantum gates.

## Qubits: Beyond Classical Bits

### Quantum State Representation

Unlike classical bits, which can only be 0 or 1, qubits exist in a superposition of states. The quantum state of a qubit can be represented mathematically as:

$|\psi⟩ = \alpha|0⟩ + \beta|1⟩$

Where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are complex probability amplitudes satisfying $|\alpha|^2 + |\beta|^2 = 1$ [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

### Qubit Characteristics

- **Superposition**: Ability to exist in multiple states simultaneously
- **Probabilistic Nature**: Measurement collapses the quantum state
- **Entanglement**: Quantum states can be correlated across systems
