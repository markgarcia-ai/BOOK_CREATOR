## Neural Network Fundamentals

Neural networks represent a powerful class of machine learning models inspired by the biological neural structures of the human brain [@Goodfellow2016]. At their core, these computational systems are designed to recognize complex patterns and learn from data through interconnected layers of artificial neurons.

### Basic Neural Network Architecture

A typical neural network consists of three primary layers:
1. **Input Layer**: Receives raw data features
2. **Hidden Layer(s)**: Processes and transforms input data
3. **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions or classifications

The fundamental mathematical representation of a neuron can be expressed as:

$y = f(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b)$

Where:
- $y$ is the neuron's output
- $w_i$ represents connection weights
- $x_i$ represents input features
- $b$ is the bias term
- $f()$ is the activation function
