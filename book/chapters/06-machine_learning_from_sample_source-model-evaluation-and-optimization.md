## Introduction

In machine learning, creating a model is just the first step. Understanding how to evaluate and improve its performance is crucial for developing reliable and accurate predictive systems [@citeKey:model_evaluation].

## Performance Metrics

### Classification Metrics
When evaluating classification models, several key metrics help assess performance:

- **Accuracy**: Overall proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: $\_LATEX_FRAC__$
- **Recall**: $\_LATEX_FRAC__$
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
\command{}}

### Regression Metrics
For regression problems, we use different evaluation techniques:

- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: $\_LATEX_FRAC__ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \_LATEX_CMD___i)^2$
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: $\_LATEX_CMD__$
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: $\_LATEX_FRAC__ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \_LATEX_CMD___i|$

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Grid Search**: Exhaustively try predefined parameter combinations
2. **Random Search**: Randomly sample parameter spaces
3. **Bayesian Optimization**: Intelligent parameter exploration [@citeKey:hyperparameter_tuning]
\command{}}

## Preventing Overfitting

### Regularization Techniques

- **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Adds absolute value penalty
- **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Adds squared magnitude penalty
- **Dropout**: Randomly disable neural network neurons during training

### Cross-Validation

- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Divide data into $k$ subsets for robust performance estimation
- **Stratified Sampling**: Maintain class distribution in validation sets

## Summary

Model evaluation and optimization are critical processes that transform raw machine learning models into reliable predictive systems through careful performance assessment and refinement.

## Key Takeaways

- Performance metrics vary by problem type (classification vs regression)
- Hyperparameter tuning helps optimize model configuration
- Regularization prevents overfitting and improves generalization
- Cross-validation provides robust performance estimates
- Continuous model evaluation is essential for machine learning success
