## What is Quantum Computing

Quantum computing represents a revolutionary paradigm in computational technology, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to process information in fundamentally different ways from classical computers [@Nielsen2010:quantum_computation]. Unlike traditional computing, which uses bits that are either 0 or 1, quantum computers utilize quantum bits or *qubits* that can exist in multiple states simultaneously through a phenomenon called superposition [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

### Fundamental Quantum Principles

Quantum computing relies on three core quantum mechanical principles:

1. **Superposition**: Qubits can represent multiple states at once, mathematically expressed as $|\psi\rangle = \alpha|0\rangle + \beta|1\rangle$
2. **Entanglement**: Quantum states can be correlated in ways impossible in classical systems
3. **Quantum Interference**: Quantum states can be manipulated to amplify correct computational paths

## Quantum vs Classical Computing

### Computational Architecture Differences

Classical computers use binary transistors that represent discrete states, while quantum computers leverage quantum phenomena to perform massively parallel computations. This allows quantum systems to solve certain complex problems exponentially faster than classical computers {{FIG:quantum-architecture:
