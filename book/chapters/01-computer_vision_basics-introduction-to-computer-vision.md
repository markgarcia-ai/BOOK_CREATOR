## What is Computer Vision?

Computer vision is a multidisciplinary field that enables machines to interpret and understand visual information from the world, much like human vision [@Szeliski2022]. At its core, computer vision aims to replicate the complex visual perception capabilities of human brains using sophisticated algorithms and machine learning techniques [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

### Fundamental Definitions

Computer vision involves several key processes:
- Image acquisition
- Image processing
- Pattern recognition
- Semantic understanding

### Relationship to Machine Learning

Computer vision fundamentally relies on machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning neural networks, to extract meaningful features from visual data [@Goodfellow2016]. The core principle involves training models to recognize patterns, objects, and contexts within images.
