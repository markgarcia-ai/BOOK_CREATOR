## Introduction to Core Machine Learning AlgorithmsMachine learning algorithms form the backbone of intelligent systems, enabling computers to learn patterns and make predictions from data [@Mitchell2017]. This chapter explores fundamental techniques that power modern artificial intelligence applications.### Regression Algorithms#### Linear RegressionLinear regression is a foundational supervised learning technique for predicting continuous values. The core model can be represented as:$y = mx + b$Where:- $y$ is the predicted value- $x$ is the input feature- $m$ represents the slope- $b$ represents the y-intercept{{FIG:linear-regression:\Linear Regression Visualization\}}Key characteristics include:- Simple and interpretable- Works well for linear relationships- Assumes constant variance in errors [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]#### Logistic RegressionDespite its name, logistic regression is used for binary classification problems. The model uses the sigmoid function:$P(y=1) = frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$Where $z$ represents the linear combination of features.### Classification Methods#### Decision TreesDecision trees partition data recursively, creating a tree-like model of decisions. Each node represents a feature, and branches represent decision rules.{{FIG:decision-tree:\Example Decision Tree Structure\}}Key advantages:- Interpretable model- Handles both numerical and categorical data- Can capture non-linear relationships [@Breiman2017]#### Support Vector Machines (SVM)SVM finds the optimal hyperplane separating different classes in high-dimensional space. The optimization problem can be expressed as:$min_{w,b} frac{1}{2} ||w||^2$Subject to constraints ensuring proper class separation.### Ensemble Learning#### Random ForestsRandom forests combine multiple decision trees to create a robust, more accurate model. Each tree votes, and the majority determines the final prediction.Key benefits:- Reduced overfitting- Handles high-dimensional data- Provides feature importance metrics#### Gradient BoostingBuilds sequential weak learners, with each new model correcting previous models' errors. Popular implementations include XGBoost and LightGBM.### Advanced Considerations#### Model EvaluationCritical metrics include:- Accuracy- Precision- Recall- F1 Score{{FIG:confusion-matrix:\Confusion Matrix Visualization\}}### SummaryMachine learning algorithms provide powerful tools for extracting insights and making predictions across diverse domains. Understanding their principles, strengths, and limitations is crucial for effective application.### Key Takeaways- Regression algorithms predict continuous values- Classification methods separate data into distinct categories- Ensemble techniques improve predictive performance- Model selection depends on data characteristics and problem domain- Proper evaluation is essential for reliable machine learning solutions
