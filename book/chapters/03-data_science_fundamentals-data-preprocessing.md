## Introduction to Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a critical phase in the machine learning pipeline that transforms raw data into a format suitable for model training [@hastie2009elements]. By carefully preparing and transforming datasets, data scientists can significantly improve model performance and reliability.

### Data Collection and Cleaning

#### Sources of Data
Data can be collected from various sources, including:
- Databases
- APIs
- Web scraping
- Sensors and IoT devices
- Public datasets [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]

#### Data Cleaning Techniques
Effective data cleaning involves several key strategies:

1. **Handling Missing Values**
   - Remove rows with missing data
   - Impute missing values using mean, median, or advanced techniques
   - Use machine learning algorithms for intelligent imputation [@little1988missing]

2. **Detecting and Removing Outliers**
   Outliers can significantly impact model performance. Detection methods include:
   - Statistical methods (Z-score, IQR)
   - Visualization techniques
   - Machine learning algorithms for anomaly detection
