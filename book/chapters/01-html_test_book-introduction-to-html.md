## What is HTML?HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and structuring digital content [@w3c:html5]. At its core, HTML provides the fundamental skeleton for web documents, defining the structure and semantic meaning of web content.### Key Characteristics of HTML- Defines web page structure- Uses tags to describe content- Platform-independent- Interpreted by web browsers### Historical Context#### Origins of HTMLHTML was first proposed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 [@berners-lee:web-history] as a way to share scientific documents across research institutions. The first publicly available description of HTML was a document called 'HTML Tags' published in 1991.#### Evolution of HTML Versions- HTML 1.0 (1991): Initial specification- HTML 2.0 (1995): First standardized version- HTML 4.01 (1999): Added support for style sheets- HTML5 (2014): Current standard with multimedia and semantic elements [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]## Basic HTML Structure### Fundamental HTML Document Template```html<!DOCTYPE html><html lang='en'><head>    <meta charset='UTF-8'>    <title>Page Title</title></head><body>    <!-- Content goes here --></body></html>```### Core Elements1. `<!DOCTYPE>`: Defines document type2. `<html>`: Root element of HTML page3. `<head>`: Contains metadata4. `<body>`: Contains visible page content## Technical Fundamentals### HTML SyntaxHTML uses tags enclosed in angle brackets to define elements. Each tag typically has an opening and closing version:```html<tagname>Content</tagname>```### Semantic MeaningModern HTML emphasizes semantic structure, using tags that describe content's meaning, not just appearance [@mozilla:html-semantics].## SummaryHTML serves as the foundational language for web content, providing structure and semantic meaning to digital documents. Its evolution reflects the web's growing complexity and capabilities.## Key Takeaways- HTML defines web page structure- Markup language interpreted by browsers- Evolved significantly since its 1991 inception- Emphasizes semantic and meaningful content representation- Supports cross-platform web document creation{{FIG:html-structure:'Diagram showing basic HTML document structure'}}
