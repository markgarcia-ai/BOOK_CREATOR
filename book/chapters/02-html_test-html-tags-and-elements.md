## HTML Tags and ElementsHTML tags and elements are the fundamental building blocks of web pages, defining the structure and content of digital documents. In this chapter, we'll explore how these components work together to create meaningful web experiences.### Common HTML TagsHTML provides a wide variety of tags for structuring content.

Always close your tags2. Use lowercase for tag names3. Indent nested elements for readability4. Use semantic tags when possible### SummaryHTML tags and elements form the core structure of web pages, providing both presentation and semantic meaning to content. Understanding their usage is fundamental to web development.### Key Takeaways- HTML tags define content structure and meaning- Semantic tags improve document accessibility- Proper nesting creates logical document hierarchies- Different tags serve specific structural purposes
