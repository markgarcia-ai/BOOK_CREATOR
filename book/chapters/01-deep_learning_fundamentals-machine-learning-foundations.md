## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a sophisticated branch of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed [@samuel1959]. At its core, machine learning focuses on developing algorithms that can automatically detect patterns in data and make intelligent decisions with minimal human intervention [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

### Fundamental Characteristics

1. **Data-Driven Learning**: Algorithms improve performance through exposure to data
2. **Adaptive Algorithms**: Systems can modify their behavior based on new information
3. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying complex relationships within datasets
