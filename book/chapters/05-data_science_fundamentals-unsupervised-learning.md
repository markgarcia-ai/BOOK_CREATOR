## Introduction to Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning represents a critical paradigm in machine learning where algorithms discover hidden patterns and structures within unlabeled data [@goodfellow2016deep]. Unlike supervised learning, these techniques do not rely on predefined labels, enabling powerful exploratory data analysis.

### Clustering Algorithms

#### K-Means Clustering

K-means is a foundational clustering technique that partitions data into $k$ distinct groups. The algorithm works by:

1. Randomly initializing $k$ centroids
2. Assigning each data point to nearest centroid
3. Recalculating centroids based on cluster members
4. Repeating until convergence

The objective function minimizes within-cluster variance:

$$J = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} \\sum_{x \\in C_i} ||x - \\mu_i||^2$$
