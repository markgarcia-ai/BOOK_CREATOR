## Introduction to Neural Network Architectures

Neural networks represent a powerful class of machine learning models inspired by the biological neural structures of the human brain. This chapter explores the fundamental design principles, specialized architectures, and advanced training techniques that underpin modern deep learning systems [@Goodfellow2016].

### Biological Inspiration and Computational Models

Neural networks simulate the interconnected neuron structure of biological systems. A fundamental neural network consists of:

- Input layer: Receives initial data
- Hidden layers: Process and transform information
- Output layer: Produces final predictions

The core computational unit is the artificial neuron, which can be represented mathematically as:

$y = f(sum(w_i * x_i) + b)$

Where:
- $y$ is the neuron's output
- $w_i$ are connection weights
- $x_i$ are input values
- $b$ is the bias term
- $f$ is an activation function [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
