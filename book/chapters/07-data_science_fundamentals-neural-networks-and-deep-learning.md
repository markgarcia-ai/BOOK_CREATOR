## Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Neural networks represent a powerful paradigm in machine learning that mimics the human brain's interconnected structure, enabling complex pattern recognition and predictive modeling [@Goodfellow2016].

## Neural Network Architecture

### Basic Structure
Neural networks consist of interconnected layers of computational units called neurons. A typical network includes:
- Input layer: Receives raw data
- Hidden layers: Process and transform information
- Output layer: Produces final predictions
