## Introduction

Welcome to the world of Python programming! In this chapter, we'll explore the fundamental building blocks of Python syntax and basic data types that form the foundation of your programming journey.

## Variables and Assignment

In Python, variables are containers for storing data values. They act like labeled boxes where you can store different types of information.

### Creating Variables
```python
# Simple variable assignment
age = 25
name = 'Alice'
```

Python uses dynamic typing, meaning you don't need to declare the type of variable beforehand [[NEEDS_SOURCE]].

## Numeric Data Types

Python supports several numeric data types for mathematical operations:

### Integers
```python
x = 10  # Whole numbers
y = -5   # Negative integers
```

### Floating Point Numbers
```python
pi = 3.14159  # Decimal numbers
temperature = 98.6
```

### Basic Mathematical Operations
```python
addition = 5 + 3       # 8
subtraction = 10 - 4    # 6
multiplication = 2 * 6  # 12
division = 15 / 3       # 5.0
```

## Strings and Text Manipulation

Strings represent text data in Python and can be created using single or double quotes.

### String Creation
```python
greeting = 'Hello, World!'
message = \Python is awesome\
```

### String Methods
```python
text = 'python programming'
print(text.upper())      # PYTHON PROGRAMMING
print(text.capitalize()) # Python programming
```

## Summary

This chapter introduced core Python syntax, focusing on variables, numeric types, and string manipulation. These fundamental concepts form the building blocks of Python programming.
