## Introduction to Quantum Algorithms

Quantum algorithms represent a revolutionary approach to computational problem-solving, leveraging the unique properties of quantum mechanics to solve complex problems exponentially faster than classical algorithms [@Nielsen2010:QuantumComputation].

### Shor's Algorithm

Shor's algorithm is a groundbreaking quantum algorithm designed for integer factorization, a problem that is computationally challenging for classical computers [@Shor1994:PolynomialTimeFactorization]. 

#### Key Characteristics
- Exponential speedup for factoring large numbers
- Potential threat to current cryptographic systems
- Utilizes quantum Fourier transform and period finding

Example quantum circuit representation:
$$Q(x) = frac{1}{sqrt{N}} sum_{a=1}^{N-1} omega^{ax} |a\\rangle$$

### Grover's Search Algorithm

Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup for unstructured search problems [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]. 

#### Core Principles
- Quantum amplitude amplification
- Reduces search complexity from $O(N)$ to $O(sqrt{N})$
- Applicable in database searching and optimization
