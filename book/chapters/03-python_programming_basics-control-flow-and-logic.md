## Introduction to Control FlowControl flow allows programmers to make decisions and repeat actions in their code, enabling complex and dynamic program behavior. In Python, we have several powerful mechanisms to control how our code executes.## If-Else Statements### Basic Conditional LogicIf-else statements help programs make decisions based on specific conditions. They allow code to execute different paths depending on whether a condition is true or false.```pythonx = 10if x > 5:    print('x is greater than 5')else:    print('x is less than or equal to 5')```### Multiple ConditionsPython supports multiple conditions using `elif` (else-if) statements:```pythonscore = 75if score >= 90:    grade = 'A'elif score >= 80:    grade = 'B'elif score >= 70:    grade = 'C'else:    grade = 'F'```## For and While Loops### For LoopsFor loops iterate through sequences like lists, tuples, and ranges:```pythonfruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']for fruit in fruits:    print(f'I like {fruit}')```### While LoopsWhile loops repeat code as long as a condition remains true:```pythoncount = 0while count < 5:    print(count)    count += 1```## Logical Operators### Combining ConditionsLogical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) allow complex condition combinations:```pythonage = 25has_license = Trueif age >= 18 and has_license:    print('You can rent a car')```## SummaryControl flow statements like if-else and loops provide powerful ways to make decisions and repeat actions in Python programs. They form the foundation of program logic and enable complex computational behaviors.## Key Takeaways- If-else statements allow conditional execution- For loops iterate through sequences- While loops repeat code based on conditions- Logical operators combine multiple conditions- Control flow is essential for creating dynamic programs
