## Introduction

Computer vision is rapidly evolving, driven by groundbreaking technologies and interdisciplinary innovations. This chapter explores the cutting-edge developments that are reshaping our understanding of visual intelligence [@LeCun2015].

## Generative Adversarial Networks

### Understanding GANs
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) represent a revolutionary approach to image generation and manipulation [@Goodfellow2014]. These networks consist of two competing neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, engaged in a dynamic learning process.

#### Key Components
- **Generator Network**: Creates synthetic images
- **Discriminator Network**: Evaluates image authenticity
- **Adversarial Training**: Continuous competitive learning
