## Introduction

Mathematics forms the core foundation of data science and machine learning. This chapter explores the essential mathematical concepts that power advanced algorithms and computational techniques.

## Linear Algebra Basics

### Vectors and Spaces
Linear algebra provides the fundamental mathematical framework for data representation and transformation. Vectors can be understood as directed quantities in multi-dimensional space [@Strang2016]. 

A vector $v = [x_1, x_2, ..., x_n]$ represents a point in n-dimensional space, where each component describes a specific attribute.

#### Key Operations
- Vector addition: $\vec{a} + \vec{b}$
- Scalar multiplication: $k \cdot \vec{v}$
- Dot product: $\vec{a} \cdot \vec{b} = \sum_{i=1}^n a_i b_i$
