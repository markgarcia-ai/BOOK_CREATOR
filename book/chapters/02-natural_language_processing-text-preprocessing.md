## Chapter 2: Text Preprocessing

Text preprocessing is a critical foundational step in natural language processing (NLP) that transforms raw text data into a structured format suitable for machine learning algorithms [@jurafsky2009]. This chapter explores essential techniques for cleaning, transforming, and preparing text data to enhance the performance of NLP models.

### Tokenization Strategies

Tokenization is the process of breaking text into individual units called tokens, which can be words, subwords, or characters [@manning2008]. 

#### Word-Level Tokenization
Simple word-level tokenization splits text on whitespace and punctuation:
