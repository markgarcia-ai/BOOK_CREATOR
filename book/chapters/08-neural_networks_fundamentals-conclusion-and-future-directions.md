## Neural Networks: Reflecting on Our Journey

Neural networks have emerged as a transformative technology, reshaping how we approach complex computational challenges. This final chapter examines the current landscape, potential limitations, and exciting future trajectories.

### Current Limitations of Neural Networks

Neural networks, despite their remarkable capabilities, still face significant challenges:

1. **Computational Complexity** [@goodfellow2016deep]: Training deep networks requires substantial computational resources [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]
2. **Data Dependency**: Performance heavily relies on high-quality, large training datasets
3. **Interpretability Problem**: Complex neural architectures often function as
