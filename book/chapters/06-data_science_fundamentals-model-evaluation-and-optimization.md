## IntroductionModel evaluation and optimization are critical processes in machine learning that determine the effectiveness and reliability of predictive algorithms. This chapter explores comprehensive strategies for assessing, improving, and fine-tuning machine learning models.## Performance MetricsPerformance metrics provide quantitative measures of a model's predictive capabilities across different types of machine learning tasks.### Classification Metrics1. **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions [@metrics_handbook:2021]   - Calculated as: $\_LATEX_CMD__}{\_LATEX_CMD__}$2. **Precision**: Measures the model's exactness   - Formula: $\_LATEX_CMD__ = \_LATEX_CMD__}{\_LATEX_CMD__}$3. **Recall**: Measures the model's completeness   - Formula: $\_LATEX_CMD__ = \_LATEX_CMD__}{\_LATEX_CMD__}$4. **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall   - Formula: $F1 = 2 \\times \_LATEX_CMD__ \\times \_LATEX_CMD__}{\_LATEX_CMD__}$### Regression Metrics1. **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared prediction errors   - Formula: $\_LATEX_CMD__ = \_LATEX_FRAC__ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \_LATEX_CMD___i)^2$2. **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE   - Provides error metric in original units3. **R-squared**: Proportion of variance explained by the model   - Ranges from 0 to 1, higher values indicate better fit## Cross-ValidationCross-validation provides a robust method for assessing model performance and generalizability.### K-Fold Cross-Validation1. Divide dataset into k equal subsets2. Use k-1 subsets for training, one for validation3. Rotate validation subset k times4. Average performance metrics across iterations{{FIG:cross-validation:\K-Fold Cross-Validation Process\}}### Stratified Cross-ValidationMaintains class distribution across folds, crucial for imbalanced datasets [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]## Hyperparameter TuningSystematic optimization of model parameters to improve performance.### Tuning Strategies1. **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over predefined parameter ranges2. **Random Search**: Randomly sample parameter combinations3. **Bayesian Optimization**: Intelligent parameter exploration### Regularization Techniques1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso)**: Promotes sparsity2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge)**: Prevents weight explosion3. **Elastic Net**: Combines L1 and L2 penalties### Practical Optimization Workflow1.
