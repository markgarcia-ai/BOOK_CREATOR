## Introduction to Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) represent a powerful class of neural networks designed to handle sequential data, making them crucial for tasks involving time series, natural language processing, and temporal dynamics [@Goodfellow2016]. Unlike traditional neural networks, RNNs possess a unique memory mechanism that allows them to retain information from previous time steps.

### RNN Fundamentals

#### Basic RNN Architecture

RNNs process sequences by maintaining a hidden state that captures temporal dependencies. The core computational graph can be represented as:

$h_t = f(h_{t-1}, x_t)$

Where:
- $h_t$ is the hidden state at time $t$
- $x_t$ is the input at time $t$
- $f$ represents the transformation function
