## Introduction to Smart Contracts

Smart contracts represent a revolutionary approach to blockchain-based interactions, enabling programmable, self-executing agreements that operate without intermediaries [@nakamoto2008bitcoin].

## Smart Contract Fundamentals

### Definition and Core Principles
Smart contracts are self-executing code snippets stored on a blockchain that automatically enforce predefined computational logic and agreement terms [[NEEDS_SOURCE]]. Their core characteristics include:

- Immutability: Cannot be altered after deployment
- Transparency: Publicly verifiable on the blockchain
- Decentralized execution: Run across multiple network nodes

### Technical Architecture
The fundamental computational model of smart contracts can be represented mathematically as:

$$ \text{Contract Output} = f(\text{Input Parameters}, \text{Predefined Rules}) $$
