## Introduction to Practical Computer Vision

Computer vision has rapidly evolved from a niche research domain to a transformative technology with wide-ranging applications across multiple industries [@Robertson2021]. This chapter explores practical implementations of computer vision technologies, demonstrating how advanced visual perception systems are solving complex real-world challenges.

## Medical Imaging

### Diagnostic Image Analysis
Computer vision is revolutionizing medical diagnostics by enabling precise and rapid image interpretation [@Chen2022:MedicalCV]. Advanced algorithms can now:

- Detect early-stage tumors with higher accuracy than human radiologists
- Analyze medical imaging like X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans
- Provide quantitative measurements of anatomical structures

#### Key Techniques
1. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image segmentation
2. Deep learning models for anomaly detection
3. Transfer learning from pre-trained medical imaging models
